# **🍻 BAC TRAC**

This is a little stream designed widget to track Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) continuosly given parameters.

To use this, download the release and open the HTML file with your browser of choice. I recommend cropping the settings part in OBS/your streaming app of choice to only show the tracking part.

BAC is calculated using all factors including weight, gender and what is being drank.

THIS DOES NOT WORK FOR COCKTAILS UNLESS YOU KNOW THE NEEDED PARAMETERS

Say you have a beer that is a 500ml bottle at 6%: You would set both the volumes to 500, ABV to 6, and sip size to however much you think you drink in a sip or mouthful. If you chug the bottle set it to the bottle size. 

You can edit the parameters if you get a new drink and it will carry on tracking as normal. 

It will slowly drop off given weight and gender over time roughly in real time. A major downside of the app is absorption time is not included. It assumes as soon as you take the drink it goes directly into the bloodstream.
